Hi i am 6876h9.
I am a CyberSecurity learner focused on ethical hacking, Linux and Windows security, cloud security, and AI security
. This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning using structured case-studies from safe, simulated, and educational environments.
The goal of this portfolio is to show how  I think about security problems, not just that I solved them.
