Hi i am 6876h9.
I am a CyberSecurity learner focused on ethical hacking, Linux and Windows security, cloud security, and AI security
. This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning using structured case studies from safe, simulated, and educational environments.
The goal of this portfolio is to show how  I think about security problems, not just that I solved them.

# WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS
    
    ####Documented: Hack the Box
    ####Try hack Me and pico ctf labs
    #### Linux and Windows privilege escalation practice
    #### Vulnerability analysis and impact understanding
    #### Defense, security, and mitigation thinking
    #### Early cloud and AI security learning


# HOW I WORK
    
### For every lab or machine, I document:

#### • How initial access was obtained
#### • What vulnerability existed
#### • How privilege escalation occurred
#### • How the issue could be fixed or prevented

### I focus on understanding why vulnerabilities exist and how defenders should respond.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

## ALL WORK IN THIS REPOSITORY IS DONE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY USING INTENTIONALLY VULNERABLE SYSTEMS.
