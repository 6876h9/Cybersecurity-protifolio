# This Folder documents my completion of the Hack the Box Linux Privilege Escalation learning path

### I have completed all modules in this path and practiced multiple Linux Privilege Escalation techniques in controlled lab environments.

## Completion status
#### • Hack the Box Linux Privilege Escalation path: Completed

##### A screenshot confirming completion is included in the completion-proof folder.

## Skills and concepts practiced

### During this path, I practiced and understood the following Linux Privilege escalation concepts:

#### • Linux file permissions and ownership
#### • SUID and SGID binaries Misconfigured sudo permissions
#### • Misconfigured sudo permissions
#### • Environment variable abuse
#### • Writeable system files and directories
#### • Cron job misconfigurations
#### • Insecure services and processes
#### • Enumeration techniques for privilege escalation
#### • Understanding attack surface before exploitation

## Learning focus

### The focus of this path was not speed, but understanding:

#### • How misconfiguration leads to privilege escalation
#### • How attackers identify escalation paths
#### • How defenders can prevent these issues
#### • Why least privilege and proper configuration matter

## How this is used in my portfolio

### Individual machine case studies related to Linux privilege escalation are documented separately with:

#### • Initial access explanation
#### • Security impact
#### • Privilege escalation path
#### • Defensive recommendations

## This folder represents foundational Linux security knowledge used throughout my other case studies.
